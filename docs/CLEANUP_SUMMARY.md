- **Reduction**: ~600MB+ (50% size reduction)

## Removed Build Artifacts

### Large Directories Removed
1. **`large-files/`** - 314MB
   - Contained `Rohit Bot 0.1.0.exe` (73MB executable)
   - Build artifacts and large executable files

2. **`release/`** - 149.7MB
   - Electron-builder output directory
   - Windows build packages and installers

3. **`win-unpacked/`** - 64.4MB
   - Unpacked Windows build directory
   - Temporary build artifacts

4. **`dist/`** - 1.42MB
   - Vite build output directory
   - Can be regenerated with `npm run build`

5. **`dist-electron/`** - 0.01MB
   - Electron build output directory
   - Can be regenerated during build process

### Files Removed
- `builder-debug.yml` - Temporary builder configuration
- `builder-effective-config.yaml` - Generated builder config
- `my-images/logo.png` - 32MB oversized logo file (kept smaller version)

## Project Reorganization

### New Directory Structure
```
├── assets/icons/          # Consolidated icon and image assets
├── docs/                  # Documentation files
├── scripts/               # Build and utility scripts
├── tests/                 # Test files
├── src/                   # Source code (unchanged)
├── electron/              # Electron files (unchanged)
├── public/                # Public assets (unchanged)
└── node_modules/          # Dependencies (unchanged)
```

### File Movements
1. **Icons and Images** → `assets/icons/`
   - Moved from `my-images/`, `.icon-ico/`, and `build/`
   - Consolidated all visual assets in one location
   - Removed duplicate and oversized files

2. **Documentation** → `docs/`
   - `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` moved from `build/`
   - Added `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
   - Added `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`

3. **Scripts** → `scripts/`
   - `convert-icons.js` - Icon conversion utility
   - `update-electron-builder.js` - Builder update script

4. **Tests** → `tests/`
   - `test-app-models.js`
   - `test-gemini-api.js`

## Configuration Updates

### Updated Files
1. **`package.json`**
   - Updated icon paths from `my-images/logo.ico` to `assets/icons/logo.ico`

2. **`.gitignore`**
   - Comprehensive build artifact exclusions
   - Added IDE files, OS files, and temporary files
   - Organized with clear sections and comments

3. **`README.md`**
   - Fixed broken image path
   - Added project structure section
   - Updated documentation links

## Benefits

### Performance
- **50% smaller repository size**
- Faster clone and download times
- Reduced storage requirements

### Organization
- **Clear separation of concerns**
- Logical directory structure
- Easy to navigate and maintain

### Development Workflow
- **Cleaner Git history** (no more large binary commits)
- Proper build artifact exclusion
- Better development experience

### Maintainability
- **Documented structure** with clear guidelines
- Consolidated assets for easier management
- Proper separation of source code and build outputs

## Build Process
All removed directories are build artifacts that can be regenerated:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development
npm run dev

# Build application
npm run build

# Package for distribution
npm run dist
```

## Next Steps
1. **Test the application** to ensure all paths work correctly
2. **Run builds** to verify the build process works
3. **Update any hardcoded paths** in the codebase if needed
4. **Consider adding automated tests** for the build process

## Notes
- All source code remains intact
- No functionality has been removed
- Build process should work exactly as before
- Icon paths have been updated in configuration files
