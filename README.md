## Vision

Kapi Lite is revolutionizing the way developers interact with their code. By bringing advanced AI capabilities directly into your development workflow, we're creating a more intuitive, efficient, and enlightening coding experience. Think of it as having a senior developer, technical architect, and coding mentor - all rolled into one intelligent companion.

### üåü Key Features

- **Intelligent Code Reviews**: Get instant, AI-powered code reviews that go beyond syntax - understanding context, patterns, and potential improvements
- **Real-time Development Assistance**: Interactive chat interface for immediate help with coding questions, debugging, and architecture decisions
- **Local-First Architecture**: Your code stays on your machine, with secure, privacy-focused AI integration
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Seamlessly works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Smart Context Understanding**: Analyzes your codebase to provide relevant, contextual suggestions
